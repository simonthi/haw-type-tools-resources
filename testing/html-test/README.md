# HTML test document


## What is this?

This is a very simple test document to test your fonts in a real world browser environment and running text. It is also a good starting point to learn about the basics of HTML and CSS. Feel free to mess around with the `index.html` and `style.css` files. In them you find optional styling options commented out using `/*` and `*/` remove them and see your code in action.

* open `index.html` in a browser of your choice and see your font in action
