# Glyphs

## Setting up and getting started
If you are new to Glyphs I highly recommend visiting the [Glyphs Learn section](https://glyphsapp.com/learn) on their website with tutorials on many topics. If you are a HAW student, there are some videos for you on the [HAW Panopto](https://emil.haw-hamburg.de/login/index.php) (just search for »Glyphs«). 

This repo here will serve as a collection of »special operations«, so sample files for setting up variable fonts with fancy gimmicks, testing OpenType features and the like.

## Samples
In this repo you can find the following sample files:
### [Stackable color font](/glyphs-samples/LayerColorFont.glyphs)
Using OT features, to make a stackable color font, with a slider for each color layer.

### [HOI playing field](/glyphs-samples/HOITest.glyphs)
An intro to HOI (higher order interpolation). Play around with not being limited to interpolatin linearly.
